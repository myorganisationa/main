Today we are releasing the biggest update ever for TFS Timetracker. It is full of great new features, so that we can’t even describe all of them here.\r\n<h2>Times Explorer with Import</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://blog.tfs-timetracker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/25-07-2014-15-50-54.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-973\" src=\"http://blog.tfs-timetracker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/25-07-2014-15-50-54.png\" alt=\"25-07-2014 15-50-54\" width=\"1016\" height=\"232\" /></a><!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe all new ‘Times Explorer’ is replacing the former ‘All Times’ page. But you won’t miss a thing. Times Explorer is a full featured explorer that allows to sort, filter, group, import, add, delete and bulk edit of tracked times. It is blazing fast. It computes total times of filtered, grouped and selected items. It adds additional information and as well as new columns like “day of the week”, or “week number”.\r\n<h2>New Role Model</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://blog.tfs-timetracker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/25-07-2014-15-46-18.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-972\" src=\"http://blog.tfs-timetracker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/25-07-2014-15-46-18.png\" alt=\"25-07-2014 15-46-18\" width=\"704\" height=\"177\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAs from now on the person who adds the time must not necessarily be the person who is working, we added throughout the system a new, easy role model, based on the idea that the worker must be always “the master of his times”. Still, the developer is in the center and TFS Timetracker is here to help him achieving his goals.\r\n<h2>Are you Active?</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://blog.tfs-timetracker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ActivityReminder_Hover1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-975\" src=\"http://blog.tfs-timetracker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ActivityReminder_Hover1.png\" alt=\"ActivityReminder_Hover\" width=\"302\" height=\"192\" /></a>\r\n\r\nWe are all very concentrated and focused. But not necessarily on time tracking. To meet that fact, the Windows client has been greatly extended. It is now a discrete co-partner for ‘not forgetting’. Not to forget to turn it on. Or to turn it off. Not to forget a thing when you are away. To turn back the time if you forget to turn it on. And, administrators: all settings can be customized on the server to meet your team’s policies.\r\n<h2>That’s all?</h2>\r\nNot at all. There is much more. Automatic filling of ‘Remaining Time’, new icons and visual improvements, improved \'My Calendar\', improved budget maintenance, enhanced export, additional settings, to name just a few.\r\n\r\nYou’ll love time management in software engineering like you never did before.', 'TFS Timetracker 2.5 is available.', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'open', '', '949-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-02-18 11:37:57', '2015-02-18 11:37:57', '', '949', 'http://www2.tfs-timetracker.com/blog/949-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

There were quite a lot changes from Team Foundation Server RC1 to its final release (RTM), which made an unusual amount of adjustments necessary. While we are doing our best to test all possible scenarios that might happen, some gaps remain. The two last releases were necessary upon reports from users to our support. Thank you guys for reporting this and helping us to fix it that quickly!\r\n\r\nNo changes have been made to the releases for TFS 2012 and TFS 2013.\r\n\r\nThe download can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.tfs-timetracker.com/download\">http://www.tfs-timetracker.com/download</a>', 'TFS Timetracker 2.6.6', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '1264-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-10-01 19:19:23', '2015-10-01 19:19:23', '', '1264', 'http://blog.tfs-timetracker.com/1264-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');
